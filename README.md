# misc
A collection of disjoint files that don't necessarily need their own repo.

- .emacs: A copy of my .emacs file to use across devices.
- RPS Data Analysis Template: A working draft of an .rmd template for reporting assessment data.
- OS installation notes: Just a few things to keep in mind when I need to re-install a new operating system. Setting up R on a fresh Linus Mint install in particular tends to give me some trouble.
